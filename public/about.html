<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello,<br>
   I'm Lebo Kgasho!
  </p>
  
<p>At 31 years old, I've recently discovered a passion for full-stack web development. This journey is an exciting new chapter for me, especially coming from a background in farming. While my roots were in agriculture, I've always been fascinated by technology and its potential to transform lives.</p>
  
  <p>Over the past few months, I've immersed myself in the world of coding, learning the ins and outs of both front-end and back-end development. I enjoy creating dynamic, user-friendly websites and applications that make a positive impact.</p>
  
  <p>In addition to my technical skills, I bring a unique perspective from my farming background, which has taught me the value of hard work, problem-solving, and innovation. I believe these qualities enhance my approach to web development.</p>
  
  <p>When I'm not coding, you can find me exploring nature, enjoying outdoor activities, or spending time with my family and friends. I'm excited to see where this journey takes me and to connect with others in the tech community.</p>
  
  <p>Feel free to reach out to me, I would like to be part of your amazing team.</p>
